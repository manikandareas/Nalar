## Database Schema Extensions

```typescript
// For quizzes
quizzes: defineTable({
  userId: v.id("users"),
  title: v.string(),
  topic: v.string(),
  createdAt: v.number(),
  questions: v.array(v.object({
    questionText: v.string(),
    options: v.array(v.string()),
    correctOptionIndex: v.number(),
    explanation: v.string(),
    type: v.union(v.literal("multiple_choice"), v.literal("true_false")),
  })),
}).index("by_userId", ["userId"]),

// For quiz attempts
quiz_attempts: defineTable({
  userId: v.id("users"),
  quizId: v.id("quizzes"),
  startedAt: v.number(),
  completedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  score: v.optional(v.number()),
  answers: v.array(v.object({
    questionIndex: v.number(),
    selectedOptionIndex: v.number(),
    isCorrect: v.boolean(),
  })),
}).index("by_userId", ["userId"]),
```

    4.  **Explanation Verification:** After 2-3 explanations, ask the user to explain the concept in their own words (e.g., "Can you explain that back to me in your own words?").
    5.  **Understanding Assessment:** Based on the user's response, assess their understanding.
    6.  **Alternative Explanations:** If the user is struggling, provide the concept from a different perspective.
    7.  **Practice & Quizzing:**
        - After a few cycles of explanation and verification, suggest a short practice problem.
        - If the user performs well, suggest a formal quiz using the `createQuiz` tool.
    8.  **Knowledge Graph Update:** Throughout the conversation, use the `updateKnowledgeGraph` tool to track the user's progress on different concepts.
